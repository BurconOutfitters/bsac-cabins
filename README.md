## Plugin Overview

This plugin provides custom post types with custom fields for documenting the cabins of Big Santa Anita Canyon and for listing them for sale. The content output and basic layout styles are provided by this plugin so it should work with any ClassicPress or WordPress theme that uses the standard content function.

## Compatibility

The plugin runs on both ClassicPress and WordPress. The custom fields for post edit forms are served by Advanced Custom Fields. Some of the fields are only available with the premium version so the [Advanced Custom Fields PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) plugin is required for this plugin to take effect.
